Introduction
Android Enterprise is a set of tools and services provided by Google as an enterprise management solution for Android devices. With Android Enterprise, you use  Citrix Endpoint Management (CEM) to manage coperate-owned and bring your own (BYOD) Android devices. 
You can manage the entire device or a separate profile on the device. The separate profile isolates business accounts, apps, and data from personal accounts, apps, and data. You can also manage devices dedicated to a single use, such as inventory management. 

For an overview of Android Enterprise capabilities from Google, see Android Enterprise Management.

Prior to Android Enterprise, companies were using Device Administrator (DA) to manage and secure Android devices. With the needs of organizations changing, devices now are reaching more corporate and confidential data than ever and at the same time end-users require protection of personal data and are concerned of their privacy. With this Google announced the deprecation of Device Administrator (DA) mode in favor for Android Enterprise, a modern management platform that focuses on security and user privacy. Google is recommending that customers using device administrator mode migrate to Android Enterprise due to Device Administrator (DA) deprecation. 

This guide is intended to provide information and best practices on how to move from a legacy device administrator Android deployment to Android Enterprise by using a managed Google Play Account.
